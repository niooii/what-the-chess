# What The Chess??!?!

What The Chess is a unique, multiplayer spin on chess, and also our BigRed//Hacks 2025 submission. Both player's recieve the same set of **AI generated pieces**, with their own unique names and rules for moving/capturing across the board. We generate pieces and their rulesets using Google's Gemini API, making the chance of getting the same pieces in different matches near zero.

The visuals aren't the best due to the lack of time. 

## Running

The project uses `uv` for venv management. To get started, run `uv sync` in the project directory.

- To run the server: `uv run -m server.main`
- To run the client: `uv run -m client.main`
